Stock Accounts in details are your warehouse accounts, from here your stocks are sent to distribution partners.
To start creating Distribution Orders on details you need to create at least one stock account first. Go to Distribution / Accounts and click the green Plus button to create a new distribution account.
Add Name, Channel (Digital / Physical), Invoice Project & Currency and click OK. Now the Distribution Account is created and you will be directed to the Overview tab. You can link in Invoice / Delivery Addresses here. Then go to the next tab Setup and select Stock Account here.
Now you can start adding Distribution Orders.
