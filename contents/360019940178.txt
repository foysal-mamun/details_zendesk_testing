If you need to import physical sales reporting files from PIAS, we provide a conversion toolkit which allows to deduct PIAS' return handling fee and provides a clean and easy file to import into det…ôils.
Open the toolkit and upload the file provided by PIAS. The files usually contain several sheets, please select sheet PHY. The toolkit has an import pre-set, you can simply click IMPORT without matching any field names.
At last, enter the return handling fee as on the summaries page on your PIAS file and enter a file name for your export file. The export will be saved on your desktop.
This converted sales import file can now easily be uploaded on Distribution / Import.
Please contact label_team@berlin3.com if you need more information on this.
