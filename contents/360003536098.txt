To select an existing one, click on the BOLD account name from the list.On the OVERVIEW subtab you can add notes and relate the account to existing contacts by clicking the green PLUS icon on top right of the contacts box.

On the subtab LICENCES, you will see all active and inactive LICENCES related to this specific account. You can ADD A NEW LICENCE, edit or remove and also duplicate an existing licence with a click on the DUPLICATE icon. This allows you to create multiple licences with separate accounting.At the bottom of the tab you can also find a button to send out a LICENCE REMINDER which will open an auto-filled reminder e-mail. Right beside you can find the NEW STATEMENT button.If you receive royalty income for multiple tracks from the same LICENCE ACCOUNT, you can easily add the INCOMES of multiple LICENCES in one go.Once the account is set up, you can ADD A NEW LICENCE.
