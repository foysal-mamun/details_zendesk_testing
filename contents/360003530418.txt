If you have changed the Artist Defaults recently (Artist section - techrider, catering...) , you might see that the changes are not appearing in the booking date or in your template.This happens because the booking dates were created BEFORE the changes were done in the artist defaults.This can be solved by clicking on the ARTIST NAME in each particular booking (see screenshot 1), and then clicking on the LOAD DEFAULTS button that you will find on the DEFAULTS section (see screenshot 2). This action is only needed for the Booking dates that were already created before the changes. Not the new ones.
