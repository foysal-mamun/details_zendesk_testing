With physical product you may want to account royalties on a certain fixed payback price agreed upon with the royalty owner. details allows you to do that ... either per FORMAT or seperate per distinct product.For this to work, you need to set up a couple of things though:1) You need to set the BASE of the royalty rate in the relevant [http://help.detailsdetails.eu/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=147|ROYALTY CONTRACTS] to PAYBACK.Since you agree to a specific payback price you will probably want to account ''100%'' of the agreed price.2) You need to set up PRICE CODES which indicate at what prices you will sell your products;Price Codes could be organized by formats, product classes, labels or otherwise.3) You need to set up PRICE LISTS for your shops and Distribution ACCOUNTS to indicate what prices (and paybacks) will apply to them.Those are the three basic elements you will need to specify ''prices (and paybacks)'' for distinct PRODUCTS when sold by distinct ACCOUNTS.Now in order for this to work, you now need to assign ''PRICE CODES to PRODUCTS'' and ''PRICE LISTS to distribution ACCOUNTS'' (shops etc.):* To assign PRICE CODES, select a product in LABEL / PRODUCTS and assign a price code from the dropdown on the OVERVIEW. After you specified a PRICE CODES you can load PRICE LISTS and add PAYBACK prices for this specific product:* Last but not least you need to assign PRICE LISTS to all of your (physical) DISTRIBUTION / ACCOUNTS, meaning shops, distributors, direct sales, etc.Now this setup process may be complex in the beginning, but will soon prove it's worth, when prices and paybacks automatically assign to orders and sales for selected products through selected accounts. Once set up, you don't need to keep the information in your head and the machine will run smoothly ... until you change the data at your discretion.nice!
