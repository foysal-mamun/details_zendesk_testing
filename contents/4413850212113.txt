The internet is a wild wild place.
For this reason, we use the certified service provider ADYEN to process secure monthly direct debits.Your SEPA mandates and credit card information are securely stored with them.
We @ details have no access to your credit card information. And we do not want to!Please do not send us any credit card information via email!
In order to update the payment information for a new bank account or a new card, a secure transmission to ADYEN must take place.
Users will find a button for this in the SETTINGS / BILLING section at the bottom right. This will redirect you to our paywall, where you can choose between a new SEPA mandate or a new card.
ADYEN requires a minimum debit of 1 EUR for this, which we forwardÂ  one-to-one to the customer
