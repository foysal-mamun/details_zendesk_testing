As booking agencies were the most affected by the Corona pandemic, we decided to reduce the user fees for booking-only users. Additionally, we did not charge for regular support to booking-only* clients in 2021.
A 'booking-only' user is allowed to access the following modules:
Contacts,
Booking,
Accounting and
Settings
In other words, the standard access to the modules  Analytics, Distribution, Label, Management  and Promotion needs to be deactivated ("hide module"):
V1
V2
Clients administrators are asked to manage the module access of their users themselves under Settings > Users.
