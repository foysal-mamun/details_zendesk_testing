How to start with details - manual
To import your contacts from a XLSX file, you need to
1) go to CONTACTS / IMPORT tab
2) download our XLSX file sample (see screenshot)
3) enter or copy your existing contacts to the XLSX template and make sure you use the right columns.
Start with the names, either the company name OR first name and last name of a person. The more info you enter, the easier it will be for detəils to help you save time.
4) Upload the file into detəils by selecting the file in the upload menu
If there's any problem, please let us help you!
5) Please note, duplicate contacts can be merged after the import.
