We continuously strive to improve our service through new features and simpler workflows.Given the multitude of business models and workflows existing in music business today our attempt to make one service for all clients is highly complex. Hence we really need to think through every new development and their implications for all our customers worldwide.Some new developments are driven by our own vision of details as a global music industry software service where others are inspired by our clients ideas. Client ideas may either be included in our own to-do-list of general improvements OR be treated as custom programming requests. Note that the definition of a general improvement is entirely at our discretion and clients have no claim to decide what constitutes a general improvement or not.Furthermore whenever clients request a feature to be dealt with as a priority, they will be asked to contribute to programming costs. A contribution has proven to be the best way to prioritize between simultaneous requests from different clients. Here is an overview about when and how much clients will be asked to contribute to our programming costs:1) if it´s a general improvement which we believe will be a benefit for all clients, we will include it as a task in ===our schedule===. All programming is free of charge to the clients as part of our ongoing development. This also includes Bug fixing which has highest priority.2) if it´s a general improvement, but client want´s to impose a priority on our programmers, ===the client will have to pay 50% of programming costs after quote===.3) if it´s NOT a general improvement, but a special client request, we might include the request as a task for our programmers in ===our schedule===, but ===the client will have to pay 50% of programming costs after quote===.4) if it´s NOT a general improvement and the client wantÂ´s to impose a priority on our programmers, ===the client will have to pay 100% of programming costs after quote===.
