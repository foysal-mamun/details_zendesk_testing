The workflow is the same in all cases:1) Go to the INFO subtab of LABEL / Artists, Labels, Releases or Products. 2) In the Related Files Box at the bottom left, either upload a file or add an existing file by clicking on the green PLUS icon on top right.3a) Select a previously uploaded file via the Search field and relate it to the current section OR3b) Upload a new file by browsing your computer or network and uploading the file to your ''details'' database. If you are aiming to upload images, make sure pictures are uploaded in a format that can be displayed in a browser. JPEG or PNG files will work fine.Also note that files must NOT be uploaded as Internal, if you want to share them with people outside of ''details''. Internal files will be inaccessible for anybody without access to your database.4) On the right side next to the Related Files Box, you will see two squares to display image files. To display your uploaded image files, click on one of the fields and select which one of your previously uploaded image files you want to display.
NOTE: Once uploaded, files will be available for this Artists, Labels, Releases or Products regardless of the display in the Artwork / Cover Box. The display will give you a visual context, but no additional functionality.
