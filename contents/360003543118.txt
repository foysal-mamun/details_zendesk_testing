Yes, details allows you to change the HTML of your templates directly in the BOOKING / TEMPLATES section.At this point we can only display the pure HTML here however and you will have to make any adjustments in there directly.We have tried to include an HTML editor into this section, but unfortunately it seems that advanced HTML conditional coding is harmed when opened with an Editor.For now you have two options: 1) let us know what changes you need in your templates at support & booking@detailsdetails.eu2) copy the template HTML in any online HTML Editor of your choice, make adjustments and copy the adjusted HTML back into details.We suggest you copy the new HTML in a NEW template, instead of replacing the existing, at least until tested.thanks for your understanding!
