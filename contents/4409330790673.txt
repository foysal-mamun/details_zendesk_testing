There are different ways that labels and distributors like to send out royalty statements to rights holders:
Some print the statements on paper, others send each statement via email individually, still others send a batch email with links to statements along with related credit notes.
In addition we will soon launch a custom B2B plattform for each detəils client where artists & labels will be able to log in and retrieve their statements online.
NOTE : Before you send out batch emails, set up your custom email templates!
You can now set custom texts for each statement layout, i.e. for different statement business identities or languages you can define different default texts.
You can add default reply-to email address as well as a sender name, i.e. which email replies should go to and how the email sender appear in your right holders' inbox.
You can choose whether or not you want the email to contain royalty amounts.
