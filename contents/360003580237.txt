details offers a very flexible way to create all kinds of customized Deal Memos in your HTML templates.Here is the full story:We have some OLD variables for the money section like[% ph.guarantee_fee %][% ph.guarantee_fee_duedate_dd %][% ph.booking_fee %]etc.Those however should no longer be used in templates, because now we have NEW variables, which are FAR MORE powerful and flexible.Truth is with flexibility also comes complexity, so yes, itÂ´s a bit more complicated to use NEW variables.Trust us, itÂ´s worth it!Variables for the Money Section of a template can be found in BOOKING / TEMPLATES under MONEY DETAILS.The NEW variables include the name of the respective INVOICE ITEM from MONEY DETAILS in parentheses.INVOICE ITEM for can be customized in SETTINGS / BOOKING / INvoice Line Groups.[% ph.invoice('Artist Fee') %][% ph.invoice('Deposit') %][% ph.invoice('Balance') %][% ph.invoice('Expenses') %]And here is where it gets sophisticated: for EACH variable we have plenty of datapoints available!If we focus one item only, say the booking fee for example[% ph.invoice('Booking Fee') %]We can now pull any piece of information related to the artist fee from MONEY DETAILS.Here is how we pull he amount, the VAT, the VAT %, the description text all from one variable only by adding an extension:Invoice number[% ph.invoice('Booking Fee').invoice_ref %]net amount [% ph.invoice('Booking Fee').price %]VAT rate [% ph.invoice('Booking Fee').tax_rate_percent | format('%.0f')%]%VAT amount [% ph.invoice('Booking Fee').price * ph.invoice('Booking Fee').tax_rate_percent / 100 | format('%.2f')%]gross amount (Fee + VAT) [% ph.invoice('Booking Fee').price * (1 + ph.invoice('Booking Fee').tax_rate_percent / 100) | format('%.2f')%]A more elegant way to get the same results with faster loading times is to define a global variable on top of your tempate and to pull all data in one go:[% booking_fee = ph.invoice('Booking Fee') %]and thenInvoice number[% booking_fee.invoice_ref %]net amount [% booking_fee.price %]VAT rate [% booking_fee.tax_rate_percent | format('%.0f')%]%VAT amount [% booking_fee.price * booking_fee.tax_rate_percent / 100 | format('%.2f')%]gross amount (Fee + VAT) [% pbooking_fee.price * (1 + booking_fee.tax_rate_percent / 100) | format('%.2f')%]Here is a list of extensions available per variable in the MONEY SECTION;'target_country' => 'United Kingdom''booking_type' => 'fee''text' => 'Artist Fee Superaki''price' => '1500.00''tax_rate_percent' => '19.000''tax_name' => '19% VAT''tax_description' => '19% MWSt''vat_type' => '1''due_date' => '2016-09-30''created' => '2016-01-25 17:40:02'If you would like a due date to be displayed in continental european format, please use the following variables:Booking Fee due date will be [% booking_fee.due_date.split('-').2 %].[% booking_fee.due_date.split('-').1 %].[% booking_fee.due_date.split('-').0 %]
