The Artists sub-heading of the Label section allows you to manage all the activity of your artists on your labels.
You can ADD a NEW ARTIST by clicking on the green "+" icon at the top right of the list.
Manage existing artist accounts/identities by clicking on the bold artist name.
You can EDIT an ARTIST by clicking on the name in BOLD.
You can DELETE an ARTIST by clicking on the red X icon in the artist list.
NOTE: The artists displayed in this section do NOT automatically correspond to those identified as Artists linked to your RELEASES, PRODUCTS or TITLES (these items may include artists outside your labels).
On the other hand, when it comes to compilations, it is obvious that your artists will NOT always be identical to those of your RELEASES and TITLES.
