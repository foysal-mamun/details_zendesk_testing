In ''details'' we enter one RELEASE DATE to the entire RELEASE which is the main release date.Specific PRODUCTS can be released earlier or later, of course. Therefor go to PRODUCT and search for the one you need to give a specific product release date.On the PRODUCT / OVERVIEW tab you can ''shift'' the release date of this particular PRODUCTS with the RELEASE SHIFT field.Right next to the shift field you can always see the main release date.In the release shift field you can now enter the shift in days. Positive numbers will lead into a product release date after the main release date and negative numbers will lead into a product release date before the main release date.For example your release has the main release date: January 25th 2016* the product 12" will be released 2 weeks (14 days) before, you now need to fill in the release shift -14. 12" release date will then be set to January 11th 2016. * the limited edition CD will be released 4 weeks (28 days) after the main release date, you now need to fill in the release shift 28. Limited edition CD release date will then be set to February 22nd 2016. * the CD version will be released on the main release date, you just leave the shift field blank. CD release date will then be set to January 25th 2016.
