Details can help setting up contracts with the copy contract function.
You can select a contract and then copy it including repertoire, share, royalty, licensing, and recoupable rates.
Go to the royalty account you want to add a contract to, select the subtab CONTRACTS and
click the green plus to set up a new contract.
In the contract modal click COPY CONTRACT.
Select the ROYALTY ACCOUNT and the CONTRACT you want to copy into your new contract and click OK.
The new contract will open so that you can make additional changes if needed.
