You might wonder why your BP Baseware reports donÂ´t match with Details sales reports.Well, there are number of reasony for this, including 1) You need to compare the corresponding periods: Where Baseware gives you all times turnover estimates, details accounts royalty periods, which may be monthly, quarterly or per half year.2) In Bassware â€žTacks Soldâ€œ is a combined display of bundle- and track sales - to compare them with details you need to count every bundle sales with their track count â€¦ meaning a bundle of 8 tracks has a track count of 8, which is what details bundle sales would need to be multiplied with to match the Bassware sales units.3) The display of single track sales in baseware only includes sales of ONE product, which one track is on.In details you get sales of the track regardless of which product it is coming from. So track sales in details could be coming from one or multiple products.4) The amount displayed in Baseware is a â€žNet Share Label Estimateâ€œ IN USD and BEFORE TAXES. MECHANICALS and DISTRIBUTION FEE deductions.For european labels you need to deduct mechanicals and sometimes tax as well. Plus if you donÂ´t have a direct Beatport account you need to deduct the aggregatorÂ´s distribution fee and apply the aggregatorÂ´s exchange rates, which will change the amounts again.5) Also please note the word â€žestimateâ€œ in Baseware â€žNet Share Label Estimateâ€œ which basically means that what they display is a best case scenario without any deductions.With all of the above, the amounts from your direct Beatport account or via an aggregator and then imported in DETAILS will NEVER be exactly what Baseware displays as â€žestimate" in USD.DETAILS accounts the NET INCOME AFTER distribution fees, discounts, mechanicals and taxes. We hope this clarifies.
