All your tracks should have set a MAIN PRODUCT.
When importing new repertoire OR creating tracks manually out of an existing PRODUCT, the main product is set automatically by details.
If you create new tracks from LABEL / TRACKS and add these to a PRODUCT afterwards, you must select the main product manually in the track, details suggests you a list of products the track part of.
Please note, tracks without MAIN PRODUCT selected are not accounted to your artist's royalty statements!
This is because not all digital shops do not provide ISRC plus BARCODE information in their sales statements, hence details cannot know from which product tracks have been streamed / downloaded. Track income will be reported in contracts containing both main product and track.
On Label / Tracks you can either scroll through your tracks list, tracks without main product show !!! in the MAIN CATALOG NO column. You can also view or export a list by using the Advances Search. Here you can select the filter Missing Main ProductÂ and either click Search to get a list within details or Export to download a file.
