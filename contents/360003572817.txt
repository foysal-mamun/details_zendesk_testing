Watch a tutorial video about Licencing HERE.In ''details'' we differentiate between business partners which you licence music FROM (i.e. licensors), whom we call ROYALTY ACCOUNTS and - on the other side - partners which we licence tracks TO (i.e. licensees), that we call LICENCE ACCOUNTS.''details'' organizes third party licences & income in LABEL / LICENCING. If you licence out a track, the first step is to SET UP A NEW LICENCE ACCOUNT.From there you can ADD A NEW LICENCE to it. Related invoices can be created directly from the licence.If you have already licenced out to the account, you can just add multiple licences to an existing account.On LABEL / LICENCES the first subtab is ALL LICENCE ACCOUNTS where you can find a list of your existing LICENCE ACCOUNTS. Here you can ADD A NEW LICENCE ACCOUNT, edit or delete.The subtab ALL LICENCES shows all existing licences. Here you can ADD A NEW LICENCE, edit and delete existing ones as well as filter and export a list of licences.At the bottom you will find the button BATCH LICENCE REMINDER.This allows you to create e-mails to all accounts that are overdue with statements in one go. By clicking BATCH LICENCE REMINDER a pop-up window will open, choose the YEAR, ACCOUNTING and PERIOD and enter the e-mail text and click OK.A customized e-mail will then be opened in your e-mail programm for each account.In order to auto-fill INVOICES and LICENCE REMINDERS, you will need to fill out the licence's STATUS, TERRITORY, CURRENCY, LICENCE TERM and ACCOUNTING PERIOD.
