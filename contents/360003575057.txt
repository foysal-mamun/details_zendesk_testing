Enter the name and short name if given, choose the sales channel physical, digital or both, select the invoice project and currencies for future accounting. Click OK to confirm.You can edit an existing distribution account by clicking on the BOLD name on the first column.To remove an existing distribution account, click the red X icon.Before the account is deleted, you will receive a warning message.
