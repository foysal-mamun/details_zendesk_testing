In LABEL / ARTISTS one of the things you can manage are Default Artist Credits. Artist credits are infos about composers, writers, publishers, etc.You can set a default in a selected artist in LABEL / ARTISTS on the OVERVIEW screen on left side of the tab. This can make your life easier when you create new tracks of new artist releases which will then ''inherit'' those default credits when you create them. Details will show you what track credits are inherited whenever you create a new track in a MODAL window.To make this work, make sure you have the following chain of relations well established:ARTIST = related to RELEASE = related to new PRODUCT = related to new TRACKOnly if this chain of relation is established can the default credits be inherited for NEW tracks. Previously created tracks will not be changed.
