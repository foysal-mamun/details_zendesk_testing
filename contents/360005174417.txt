Update April 2023 : WeConvert will terminate it´s service in May 2023.Instead, details will now provide it´s own internal solution to automatically download, convert and make sales available in details.
This replacement will enable a fully automated sales ingestion directly from iTunes, Amazon or Merlin accounts directly into the details plattform. Other services will follow.
For the time being, we will keep the same prices as WeConvert until our investment in programming has recouped, and later integrate this additional service into our general pricing.
