Watch a TUTORIAL videop about how to create ROYALTY ACCOUNTS and CONTRACTS for artist releases here.Each ROYALTY ACCOUNT has the subtabs Setup, Contracts, Recoupable/Costs, Statements and Balances which are explained step by step below.''Excursions''* HOW TO SET UP A NEW CONTRACT - ARTIST RELEASE* HOW TO SET UP A NEW CONTRACT - COMPILATION* CREATE ROYALTY STATEMENTTo create a new ROYALTY ACCOUNT, go to LABEL / ROYALTY and click [+] on top right of the list. Enter the ACCOUNT NAME, ROYALTY PERIOD and choose an INVOICE PROJECT for the statements. Click OK and you will be directed to the account's SET UP subtab where you can choose a main contact and add more contacts if wished, add notes and upload related files such as Licence agreements, HOAs etc.It is essential to choose an ACCOUNT BASE for the statements which defines to which date/period the income of a sale is collected to and hence accounted to your royalty statements.There are three options:* Payment Period: All income of sales will be collected to the period in which the invoice for the sales income has been paid by the sales account.* Sales Period: All income of sales will be collected to the period of the actual sale.* Invoice Date: All income of sales will be collected to the period in which invoice has been created.''Example''Your records have been sold in December 2016. This is the SALES PERIOD. If you select SALES PERIOD as royalty base, the income will be accounted in the royalty period 2HJ 2016 or Q4 2016 if you account quarterly.You will probably receive and import the sales statement from your distributor in January 2017 and create an invoice or receive a credit note dated January 30th 2016. This is the INVOICE DATE.If you select INVOICE DATE as royalty base, the income will be accounted to the period 1HJ 2017 or Q1 if you account per quarter or 01 2016 if you account monthly.Then you will probably not receive any money and the invoice in ''details'' will not be selected as "paid" before March 2016. This is the PAYMENT PERIOD. If you select PAYMENT PERIOD as royalty base, the income will be accounted in the period 1HJ 2017 or Q1 if you account per quarter.Please note that you should NEVER change the account base after you have created and send out a royalty statement. If you change the ACCOUNT BASE after you have already created a sales statement for your royalty account, it will happen that you account particular sales in several periods OR that you do not account particular sales at all.Contact details support if you need help!On the subtab CONTRACTS you can ADD A NEW ROYALTY CONTRACT, edit and delete existing contracts.The subtab RECOUPABLE/COSTS shows you all costs related to the specific ROYALTY ACCOUNT.
