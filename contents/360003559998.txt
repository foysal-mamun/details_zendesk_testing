We are happy to provide an efficient workflow to automatically ingest your BANDCAMP Orders into details.Please note that at this point the API provided by Bandcamp handles the ingestion FOR PHYSICAL PRODUCTS ONLY.As soon as Bandcamp provides a solution for digital sales, we will include that as well.So what this PLUGIN offers is to automatically retrieve and ingest all Bandcamp orders for physical product and merchandise into details / Distribution / Orders. The information transferred to details includes the order items, order quantities and prices, order reference, invoice contact, delivery contact and shipping. We may automatically add default values of the account, such as invoice identity, stock account, payment method, price list, shipping type and order weight.The cost of this Plugin is 0.10 EUR per imported order. We believe the time you save on every order should be worth it.Here are the steps you need to take to use this:(1) Contact Bandcamp and ask them for your API credentials.Keep them safe!(2) After you received the credentilas, log into details and go to Settings / Label / Additional Info.(3) In API configs create a new API and add your credentials and a description (something like "Bandcamp my label")(4) In Distribution / Accounts make sure you have a distribution account named Bandcamp or including that exact string.To find out how to add new distribution accounts, click [http://help.detailsdetails.eu/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=169|HERE].(5) Go to Distribution / Plugins and ACTIVATE the plugin "Auto-Ingest Bandcamp Orders".This Plugin will add a button to DISTRIBUTION / ORDERS to load Bandcamp orders via API.(6) Click again on the green icon of the plugin to confirm that the usage for the Bandcamp auto-ingestion will be billable at 0.10€ per order until further notice.(7) Refresh your application with CMD + R and log back into details.(8) Go to Distribution / Orders: You should now find a new button at the bottom right which says Get Bandcamp Orders and the number of open orders detected in your Bandcamp account.(9) Click on the button Get Bandcamp Orders.(10) details will display all items included in the available orders. Match those items to your repertoire. To do that search in the dropdown selection for the reference of your product.Note: details will offer you physical products only to choose from, so don't worry about selecting digital products by mistake.(11) When all items are matched, continue with OK.The matches that you did now will be saved for future reference.(12) details will now display all order contacts, i.e. the people who ordered in this batch.All contacts are selected for import by default. Note: details will import every order one time only.If you happen to know that orders were previously dealt with manually however, you should probably de-select them to avoid importing them again!
(13) Click on OK to import all selected orders.You will now find all imported orders in your list of orders in Distribution / Orders.Whenever you load the Order list, details will check if new orders are available for ingestion.You will see the number of available orders for import in brackets.Additional infos on advanced setups for Bandcamp imports:You may set DEFAULT values for Bandcamp orders on the Overview and Setup tabs within the Bandcamp distribution account, such as
* the default invoice identity (invoice project)* the default payment method* the default price list
