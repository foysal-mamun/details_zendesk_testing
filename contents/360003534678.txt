An easy way to import not only single contacts, but also entire groups of contacts into details is to import a standard vCard formatted file (.vcf).The Mac addressbook application exports vCard format (see screenshot), but other software do it, too, as ''vCard'' is a standard for electronic business cards.NOTE: You can import many contacts in one go, if you select a GROUP and export it as vCard!If you are not using Mac, check the export options of your address book. You might also export your contacts in a different format and convert it into vCard later using an file converter such any tool as found here.Now that you have one or multiple vCard to immport1) go to details' CONTACTS / IMPORT tab2) click on IMPORT FROM VCARD button and select the file to upload.details will automatically create "Companies" from Company-contacts and "Individuals" from people.If there's any problem, please let us help you!V1
