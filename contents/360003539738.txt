There are many ways to manage a label and handle your daily workflows.Will all labels need a tool like details? Well, if you start with a limited amount of releases and artists and go through one single distributor or digital aggregator, you can probably manage with Excel and the tools provided by your distributor.Also you might probably negotiate one-off flat fees with artists to licence single tracks or EPs instead of royalty deals.You will only need a database tool such as ''details'', when a) you canÂ´t keep everything in your head any moreb) you need one place to put it all instead of various spreadsheets, dropboxes etc.c) your income streams get too diversed) you are working in a teame) digital sales files just get too big, especially for streamingf) you have deadlines that require a streamlined workflowg) you need to provide periodical royalty statementsSo one reason that clients will come to us is that their business goes beyond what they can handle themselves in Excel.Having said that, we try to be as easy to use and intuitive as possible within the ever changing complexity of music biz, physical and digital distribution and metadata requirements.Another reason is that they want to be independent from one single distributor or digital aggregator. Unlike other tools, we do NOT push you into any specific distribution deal. As a matter of fact our professional clients work with 10,20,30 and more different distributors for different channels and in different territories worldwide.In other words: ''details'' provides a structure which allows you to be really independent - even from your distributors.(...)So do we consider ''details'' a tool for "professionals"?Yes, we definetly target music businesses, who need structured databases to handle the amount of their releases, channels and setups.
