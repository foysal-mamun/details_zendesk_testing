Our Royalty Accounts may have multiple contracts. (1 account = n contracts)Each contract has their own "economy", meaning their own advance, incomes, costs, reserves and balances.Within one Royalty Account therefore you may have contracts with positive balances at the same time as others with negative balances.The 'Cross Collect' checkbox gives you the option to decide whether or not you want the contract-level 'economies' balanced on the level of the Royalty Account.And yes, we recommend setting the cross-collect as active per default!example 1 - non cross-collected:Royalty Account Acontract 1 - positive balance 500 EUR payoutcontract 2 - negative balance -1000 EUR forwardBalance Account A: 500 EUR payout
