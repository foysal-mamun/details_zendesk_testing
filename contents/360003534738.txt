API URL Structure:
Each API URL has the following structure:
https://api.berlin3.com/api/berlin3/?action=get_products_tracks_id_barcode&api_key=12345
If we break down the URL, each url contains two essential parts:
*action: This specifies the sort of action we want to perform.
Example: get_products_tracks_id_barcode(this fetches the external id and external table)
*api_key: This is the Unique Key specified for you from Details.
This can be found at Settings>Sharing.
