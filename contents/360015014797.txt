If you want to delete a sales import that has already been accounted, you need to cancel the invoice first (but make sure before, the invoice hasn't been forwarded in the accounting process!)
1. ACCOUNTING / INVOICES
find the invoice connected to the sales import and cancel it via the Pen Symbol on the right.
2. DISTRIBUTION / ACCOUNTS
Once the invoice is cancelled, the sales import shows up again in the CURRENT STATEMENTS tab of the distribution account.
You can delete the sales import by clicking the red X.
TRY TO AVOID DELETING AND ALWAYS CONSIDER IF THERE IS ANYTHING CONNECTED TO THE DELETED ITEM.
