If you want to automatically transfer your repertoire via our API, you must maintain a certain level of metadata integrity, otherwise your catalogue cannot be delivered first to p.r.o. agency and later to the collecting societies worldwide.
The entire revenue channel depends critically on you providing metadata accurately and fully.If you provide clean data, the whole process from details to the p.r.o. agency to the collecting societies and to hundreds of revenue-generating outlets will have a chance to be largely automated.But the whole process really relies on your catalogue management.The following fields are mandatory for the process, i.e. if those are not available in details tracks will not be able to be delivered to p.r.o. agency through the API.
