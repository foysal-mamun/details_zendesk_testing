''details'' offers to publish all relevant RELEASE and PRODUCT infos in fully customizable documents, commonly known as "Infosheets", "One-Sheets" or "Product Infos" ===To print infosheets from details you will need a custom template=== which either we OR any fellow HTML designer can create from your current layout. Remember you can fully customize it to your needs!  Once you have a template available here is how you can open the Infosheet: => LABEL / RELEASES / selected RELEASE / OVERVIEW / button DOCUMENTS  Here is an overview of the datapoints youÂ´ll need to have filled out for a fully populated infosheet on the different levels: RELEASE Datapoints   PRODUCT Datapoints   TRACK Datapoints  ARTIST Datapoints  - - - - - If you want to customize your own HTML template here is a sample code including most relevant datapoints: Also here is a list of currently available datapoints for your custom tenplates. Probably there will be more in the future as requirements will change.
RELEASE Infos  Artist: [% release.release_artist %] Title: [% release.release_title %] Release Date: [% release.release_date %] Label: [% release.label_name %] LC Code: [% release.label_code %] Genre: [% release.genre_name %] Artwork 1: [% release.artwork1_link %] Artwork 2: [% release.artwork2_link %] Infotext EN: [% release.release_info_english | html | html_line_break %] Infotext 2nd: [% release.release_info_second | html | html_line_break %] Notes: [% release.notes %] Identifier: [% release.identifier %]  PRODUCT Infos  Catalog No: [% release.products.catalog_no %] Format: [% release.products.format_name %] UPC / Barcode: [% release.products.barcode %] Retail Price: [% release.products.ppd %] Release Shift: [% release.products.release_shift %] Attribute 1: [% release.products.attribute1 %] Attribute 2: [% release.products.attribute2 %] Attribute 3: [% release.products.attribute3 %] Weight: [% release.products.weight %] Notes: [% release.products.notes %] Digital / Physical: [% release.products.digital_physical %]  TRACK Infos  Set No: [% product.tracks.set_no %] Track No: [% product.tracks.seq_no %] Track Artist: [% product.tracks.artist %] ISRC: [% product.tracks.isrc %] Title: [% product.tracks.title %] Version: [% product.tracks.version %] Playtime: [% product.tracks.playtime %]  ARTIST Infos  Artist: [% release.artists.artist_name %] Bio English: [% release.artists.bio_engl %] Bio 2nd language: [% release.artists.bio_own %] Artist Picture 1: [% release.artists.artwork1 %] Artist Picture 2: [% release.artists.artwork2 %] Artist URL1: [% release.artists.url1 %] Artist URL2: [% release.artists.url2 %]  Here are a few additional tips for HTML Designers to create custom infosheets: To include artwork or logos into your infosheets, use this code:  "link to picture" needs to be replaced with a link to the picture or logo. You may upload both as files to details as outlined HERE If you want to loop the same display for multiple items like for all products or tracks, use the FOREACH function:  List of Products: [% FOREACH product = release.products %] [% product.format_name %]: [% product.catalog_no %] [% product.title %] [% product.version %] [% END %]  or  Tracklist: [% FOREACH track = product.tracks %] [% track.seq_no %]. [% track.title %] [% track.version %] ([% track.playtime %]) [% END %]  or  [% FOREACH artist= release.artists%] [% artist.url1 %] [% artist.url2 %] [% END %]  Sometimes you may want to display some part of a loop only once and not repeat per iteration. You can limit a text display to one time only if you fix the iterations to 1like this:  [% IF loop.count == 1 %] This will be only displayed once, even when part of a loop [% END %]  You might want to make Weblinks clickable in your template. Use this function  Artist URL1: [% release.artists.url1 %] Artist URL2: [% release.artists.url2 %]  NOTE: at this point you will need to contact us with your custom HTML to include it into the database.
