The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is an international standard code to identify sound recordings and music video recordings.The ISRC code is always 12 characters long, in the form "CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN". The hyphens are not part of the ISRC code itself and are therefore left out in DETAILS.The four parts are as follows:* "CC" is the appropriate two-character country code for the ISRC issuer. * "XXX" is a three character alphanumeric registrant code of the ISRC issuer.* "YY" represent the last two digits of the reference year â€“ the year that the ISRC was assigned to the recording. This is not necessarily the date the recording was made, but oftentimes the date of the release.* "NNNNN" is a 5-digit number that identifies the particular recording, unique within the scope of the reference year.In DETAILS we included the option to automatically create subsequent ISRC code automatically:To generate a new code click on the grey icon in the IRSC column for a selected track in the tracklist of a PRODUCT, i.e. in LABEL / PRODUCTS / selected product / TRACKSFor this to work, please make sure that the following 3 conditions are met:1) the TRACK needs to be related to a PRODUCT which needs to be related to a RELEASE.2) the RELEASE needs to have a release date and needs to be related to a LABEL.3) the LABEL needs an ISRC base set, which is the "CC" and "XXX" partz of the ISRC code.You can set the base in LABEL / LABEL / selected Label / Overview.
