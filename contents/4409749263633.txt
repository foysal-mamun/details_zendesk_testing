There are different ways to send out royalty statements to rights holders in detəils.
If you want to send a batch email out to a selection of royalty accounts including links to access statements, you need  to set up a template for the email that will be send.
You can set custom texts per statement layout, i.e. for different statement business identities or languages you can define different default texts.
You can add default reply-to email address as well as a sender name, i.e. which email replies should go to and how the email sender appear in your right holders' inbox.
You can choose whether or not you want the email to contain royalty amounts.
For existing clients we have set up a standard template, which looks something like this :
To customize your own email templates
Go to Setting > Identities
Select the royalty project you want to customize and click on the new subtab Statement Email.
Enter the Sender Name that will  be displayed in the recipients email inbox
Enter a Reply To email address which recipients will now be able to directly reply to from your statement emails!NOTE : Sender Name & Reply To will be used for both standard batch emails and future B2B emails.
In the Box Standard Statement Email on the left side of the subtab enter your custom email subject (example: "Your Royalty Statement") and
Add a text template to be used for future standard batch emails with this statement layout.
NOTE : For both email subject and text you can use the variable $period$ which will automatically be replaced with the period of the statement you are sending out.
