The 2020 coronavirus crisis not only continues to threaten the lives of millions of people around the world, but also has a profound impact on the entire creative industries in Europe and worldwide.
The economic consequences hurt all the music companies badly, but we support each other, look for alternatives and somehow hang in there.
During the Corona crisis, people have learned how important music is in their lives and how fundamentally important many areas of the music industry are to social life. This shows that we have a great responsibility ... for the music and for each other in the music sector.As an act of partnership and solidarity we have been applying a 50% Corona discount to all our clients since March through December 2020.As booking agencies were the most affected, we want to continue to provide support by permanently reducing the user fee for booking-only users* to â‚¬ 25 per month net of VAT. Additionally, we will not charge for regular support to booking-only* clients in 2021.
For all other customers, however, we need to return the fees to our previous rates in 2021, so our published PRICING will apply again starting January 2021.
*a "booking-only user" would have access to the menu sections CONTACTS, BOOKING, ACCOUNTING and SETTINGS, but not to LABEL, DISTRIBUTION, PROMOTION or MANAGEMENT. Module access of users should be configured independently by the customers in SETTINGS / USER.
