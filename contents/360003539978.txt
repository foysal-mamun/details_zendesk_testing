When importing sales or cost statements into ''details'' it happens that not all items from the import file can be matched automatically with your items set up in ''details''.Not matching items can occur due to differing identifiers such as barcodes, catalogue numbers or ISRCs.These items must be matched manually in each statement importing process on the statements subtab Import Matches where all unmatched items are listed. You can click on the unmatched item and either select from the suggestions ''details'' shows according to the identifier or you can search manually in your database.Once you have selected the correct match, you can confirm with OK.Each manual match you create while importing a statement will be saved for future statement imports of the related account only.You can find all manual matches related to a DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT on the distribution account's subtab Setup.To delete a manual match of a product, go to the PRODUCT's subtab SPECIAL and click the red X icon in the list.To delete a manual match of a track, go to the TRACKS's subtab RELEASES / PRODUCTS / LICENCING and click the red X item in the list.
