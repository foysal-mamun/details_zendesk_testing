The custom task list is a tool to organize work in teams.We designed this feature specifically for teams that may or may not work in seperate offices and need to be assured on WHO did WHAT and WHEN. You may set single tasks or entire groups of tasks and assign them to any user in your team.Common tasks would be to chase contracts or payments, notify travel agents or book travels or alert promotion departments ... but you are free to add any kind of task that is relevant to your company.Whenever a task is checked, both the user that assigned the task and the user who it was assigned to, will see that the task is done, by whom and when it was done.To create a new task simply typa a new task description into the "SEARCH" field on top right. If the description is new, the button will change from "SEARCH" to "ADD ITEM".To create a new group of tasks, select tasks with the checkbox, add a new group name at the bottom and assign the group to a user. You may edit a group name later if needed.NOTE: This feature is introduced in 06 2018 in a first useful version in the BOOKING module only.We welcome any feedback and requests for amendments in order to optimize the feature for you and will introduce it to LABEL and other modules accordingly!
