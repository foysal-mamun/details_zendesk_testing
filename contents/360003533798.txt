If you want to customize the fields you want for the Booking Request Form or the Questionnaire, please follow these guidelines:You just need to go to: Settings - Booking Settings - Request Settings
Then you can pick which fields you want in both of them, and which of them should be 'mandatory' for the promoter.
If you want to create a personal custom field, you can just add it on the proper section clicking on the 'Plus' button.
