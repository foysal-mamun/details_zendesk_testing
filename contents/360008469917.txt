Details offers a free import of repertoire from a standard XLS file. You can download the import template here.
The template includes release related, product related & track related data. All bold columns in the sheet are mandatory data we need in order to import your file.
Please note: If you release your music on multiple formats (CD, LP, Digital etc) you will need to add EACH format variation in the import file (columns barcode, catalog number & format should be different per format).
Once you have finalized the import file, go to LABEL / PLUGINS and activate the import plugin:
ADVANCED Repertoire Import - Multi Label
or
ADVANCED Repertoire Import - Fix Label
If you want to import extended files (including prices, custom metadata fields, etc) or multi-label files you will need to activate the advanced import plugins. Please see here for more info.
To upload your file, click the upload symbol and select your file. Details will show a preview of products to be imported (you can still exclude products here) and a preview of tracks (you can exclude tracks here such as duplicates). Click Process to import your file.
You can now review your import within details.
