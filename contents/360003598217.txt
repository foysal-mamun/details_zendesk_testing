If in your royalty contract it is agreed that the label receives a fix amount per record you can do like that:- Set up one contract "royalty" where royalty account receives 100% on income on physical.Add one option entering 100% on income - Next set up a second contract "fix price". Add one physical option entering 100% on fix, and add the fix PPU agreed on as negative number, i.e. -1.00 if you agreed on 1 â‚¬ per copy.The Royalty account will receive all physical income but with a fix deduction per unit that will remain with label.
