If you need to remind multiple licence accounts to send their due statements you can use the BATCH STATEMENT REMINDER.  To remind only one LICENCE ACCOUNT you can do so within the account.  To remind in a batch go to LABEL / LICENCING and subtab LICENCES. At the bottom you will find the button BATCH LICENCE REMINDER.  This allows you to create emails to all accounts that are overdue with statements in one go. By clicking BATCH LICENCE REMINDER a module window will open. Choose the YEAR, ACCOUNTING and PERIOD and enter the e-mail text and click OK.     A new module window will open showing the licence accounts affected. From here you can either a) click on the email icon to create an email with the reminder info to the certain licence account b) click SEND ALL at the bottom of the wingow to create all emails  A customized e-mail will then be opened in your e-mail program for each account including the text you entered, all licences related and last statement sent.  You can now send them individually from your e-mail client so that you also have them in your outbox.   To remind a single licence account you can go to LABEL / LICENCING. Select the licence account and go to subtab licences. At the bottom you will find REMINDER EMAIL which will open an email including all licences affected in your email client.
