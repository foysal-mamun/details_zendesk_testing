In details you have the option to ''merge'' duplicate contacts as opposed to ''deleting'' them. Deleting double contacts may cause loss of additional information or CONTACT RELATION that is connected to one contact, but not the other. Merging contacts instead allows you to keep the best available data from both previous contacts, remove outdated or irrelevant information and keep your contact database clean at the same time.In DETAILS keeping the CONTACT RELATIONS, i.e. the "use of your business cards" in different parts of the software is essential, so merging contacts is highly recommended!To proceed with this click on the MERGE CONTACTS button on the lower section.===(1) Find contacts to merge===A little window will appear that allows you to SEARCH or filter specific contacts to merge:* Enter any text in the SEARCH field to search fo a specific contact* Click the "Company Name" checkbox (blue) to filter all double company names from your contact list* Click the "Last Name" checkbox (green) to filter all double last names from your contact list* Click the "Email" checkbox (pink) to filter all double emails from your contact listNOTE: Companies and Individuals might have same emails, so merging contacts "by email" may not be the best idea if you want to keep companies and people separate.===(2) Select contacts to merge===Once you searched or filtered your contacts you need to select 2 of them which you want to merge together.Select both with a tick of the selection checkbox and continue with [OK] ===(3) Select which contact to KEEP ===On the next window you will be asked to SELECT ONE of both contacts to KEEP.This should be the most updated or most complete contact. The other contact - the one NOT selected - will be removed after all data relations have been automatically transferred to the first one in the merge process.NOTE: you can still copy relevant information from the contact which will be removed to the one which will be kept with simple copy & paste.===(3) Select [OK] to merge contacts ===
