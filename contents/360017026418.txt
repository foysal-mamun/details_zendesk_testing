(1) Instructions on how to retrieve your directory on IDOL after setting up the API
Once the Integration has been set up, to load your cataloque from IDOL,
go to LABEL / PLUGINS to your Active Plugins in the API section to the plugin
Auto-Ingest new products from idol.io.
Click "Run" to start cataloque recovery, which may take a few minutes to load the data.
(2) Instructions on how to set up the API integration
To automatically insert your IDOL catalogue, you must first create an user for detəils in the idol.io labelcamp.
Only administrators can create users, so contact the administrator of your label for the IDOL labelcamp. The administrator needs to create a user "details", but should not give any role to the user in question (neither catalogue management, nor analytics, nor accounting).
Then go to detəils and put the user name and password in SETTINGS / LABEL / Additional Info API Configs as displayed below:
In addition you need to activate the plugin "Auto-Ingest new products from idol.io“ in LABEL / PLUGINS / API
Once the Plugin is activated, OnClick on the button „Run", it will ingest new products and tracks directly from your idol.io account.
Note :
The API will identify all already existing products by "upc-code" (barcode) and skip them.Existing tracks will alsobe skipped when identified by artist, tittle and IRSC.
