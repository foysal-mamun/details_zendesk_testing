details now has a feature to deactivate royalty contracts.This can be useful if your contract has ended or has been amended and you no longer wish to include that contract in the royalty statements.
The deactivation of a contract results in a contract being archived, but not deleted!
A deactivated contract stops processing any income or recoupables and will not be displayed in royalty statements. In most cases, especially if there is a contract history, this is a much better option than removing contracts, which results in previous reporting periods being deleted from your database.
A deactivated contract will no longer
- not process any new royalties for sales, returns or licences
- not recoup any new advances, other incomes or costs
- not load any new repertoire via the autofetch function
A deactivated contract will however still
- forward previous closing balance of the previous period
- account contract balances if added manually
- account previously imported recoupables
- credit previous return reserves when due
NOTE : If previous balances, return reserve credits or closing balances are still existing, the deactivated contract will still be visible on the statement.
To deactivate a contract, you need a contract status set to inactive.
Go to SETTINGS / LABEL / ADDITIONAL INFO, add or edit a new status on the Label Status box and set section = Royalty Contract. For contract deactivation status check the [x] inactive checkbox!Note : The deactivating contract function will only apply if also the inactive flag is selected!
Now, go to LABEL / ROYLATY / CONTRACTS, select a contract you want to deactivate and choose the inactive status from the dropdown menu.
Please note, the deactivation will start as you select an inactive status. The contract start date and end date do not affect the deactivation!
