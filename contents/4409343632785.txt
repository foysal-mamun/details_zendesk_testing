To meet current security standards, the password reset procedure will be updated with the next update.
When requesting a new password, you will receive an email with a recovery link and instructions on how to set up a safe password.
In order to receive these emails, please make sure that your user accounts have valid emails! All detəils client admins can add / edit user emails related to detəils logins in Settings > Users.
