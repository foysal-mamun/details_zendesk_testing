detəils offers a free import of repertoire from a standard XLS file.
You can download the import template here.
The template includes release related, product related & track related data. All bold columns in the sheet are mandatory data we need in order to import your file.
Please note: If you release your music on multiple formats (CD, LP, Digital etc) you will need to add EACH format variation in the import file (columns barcode, catalog number & format should be different per format).
