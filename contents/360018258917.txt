As you might or might not know an iCal subscription is basically a text file (in an international standard format called ics).The more dates are included in that file, the bigger it gets.And the bigger a file gets, the longer it takes to download when it´s updated.Now when text files get too big, smartphones may not be able to load all data within the time-frame defined by their settings. What happens then is a so called "time-out" which means new dates don´t get uploaded anymore.This is the reason why the iCal you subscribe to in our ''details artist iCal subscription feed'' displays all bookings between previous 1 month and next 1 year of your artists. It removes all booking dates older than 1 month and newer than 1 year.i) use the ARTIST APP => This web interface can be opened on PC/Mac as well as on smartphonesii) details => BOOKING => ARTISTS => Bookings Dates ¦ lists all bookings of the selected artistiii) details => BOOKING => BOOKING LIST => ¦ lists all bookings of the all or selected artist
