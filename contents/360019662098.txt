The calculation of royalties depends largely on the terms of the licence agreement and the resulting accounting rules.
Put simply, royalties are calculated by multiplying a sales quantity at a specific base price with a royalty rate. A simple example would be 1.000 CDs * 7 € PPD * 20% royalty rate = 1.400 €.
However, if royalty calculation was always this simple, there would be no need for a database solution like detəils. This article shows you how to set up more complex rules for royalty calculation correctly.
In detəils you can manage rules for royalty calculation seperatly for each channel
physical sales
digital sales
licensing / thirdparty revenue
performance revenue
Each channel can have one or multiple rules or royalty options as we call them.
