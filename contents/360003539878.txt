Some statement files you receive from your DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNTS might need to be prepared before you can import them into ''details''.Below you will find a list of issues and how to solve them in order to import your sales statement files succesfully.* File format''details'' supports imports of .xls / .csv / .tab files at the moment.If you receive a .xlsx file, this needs to be converted to one of the above file formats before importing.* Several tabs in one excel fileSome accounts send an overall statement file including all statement types (physical, digital, cost) in one excel file, separated in different sheets.Though, in ''details'' you can only import one sales statement in one sheet.To import the single statements, each statement needs to be saved in a seperat file.Open the original file in excel and check if there are several tabs at the bottom. If so, you can easily select the relevant sheet, click on the sheet title and drag and drop it on your desktop.This will not remove the sheet from the original file, this just opens the separated sheet in a new file.Now you can save the new file and rename accordingly.* Standard formattingTo import all data correctly, files must be uploaded in standard formatting to avoid importing any kind of date or currency formats, which will lead into failing imports.You can change the formatting by selecting everything (all rows), then go to format, select Standard and save the file.* Removing additional rowsSome statement files include additional rows, e.g. sales summaries, total lines etc.These additional rows need to be removed before importing so that the first row is the header of the table and the table ends with the last sales row. You have to delete all additional rows and save the file.
