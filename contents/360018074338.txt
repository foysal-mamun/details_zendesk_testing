The idea of the PLUGIN report is to compare stock levels to recent sales performances.
The idea is that only items with a certain sales performance have a stock relevance, since you may be more  interested on the fact that a product goes out of stock for an item that sells a lot then on items that have not moved for the last half year.
So the report gives you stock levels of items that have been sold in recent months.
The „Offset Qty“ in that query is the amount of sales which is used as filter for your report.
If you set „Offset Qty“ to 1, it will give you a report of all items that have at least sold 1 unit in the last 6 months.If you set „Offset Qty“ to 5, it will give you a report of all items that have at least sold 5 units in the last 6 monthsetc.
