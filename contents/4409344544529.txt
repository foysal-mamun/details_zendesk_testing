Some of you have noticed that old browser bookmarks starting with WWW stopped working with recent Firefox updates. Those need to be updated!
OLD URLs started with https://www.detailsdetails.eu/YourclientID*/
NEW URLs need to be https://app.detailsdetails.eu/YourclientID*/
In other words, please replace "WWW" with "APP".
This concerns all details links such as application bookmarks or booking request forms.
*replace YourclientID with your database name.
